# rust_entertainment_system
At first this project is intended to be a Rust NES emulator, but then I'm too lazy to finish my projects, so this will be a collection of attempts to do emulation while playing with the Rust language.

## Chip8
I'm beginning with this project, as I'm a newcomer in the emulation :
